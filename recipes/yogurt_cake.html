    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fluffy, moist, and delicious cake is prepared quickly. I decided to use some ripe bananas that 
        were left in the fridge for this recipe.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vinegar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>3 bananas</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>Splash of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pot of yogurt (120g)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups self-raising flour</li>
            <li>Handful of chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash the bananas and mix with the tablespoon of honey and the vanilla extract. Set aside.</li>
            <li>
                In a bowl, beat the eggs well. Continue beating and add the oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, 
                yogurt, and cream cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually add the flour to the mixture, alternating with the mashed bananas. Finally, fold in 
                the chocolate chips, reserving some to sprinkle on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the batter into a greased mold, sprinkle some chocolate chips on top, and bake in a 
                preheated oven at a gentle temperature of 170°C (340°F) until a toothpick inserted into the 
                center comes out clean. Let it cool slightly in the mold, then transfer to a cooling rack 
                to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>Very fluffy and light, delicious for sharing with family!</li>
        </ol>

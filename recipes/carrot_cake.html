    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Looking for a simple Carrot Cake recipe, I came across Paulina Cocina's and decided to get to work. 
        Not only was it easy, but it also turned out very delicious, and the combination with the lemon glaze 
        was spectacular.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>175 cc sunflower oil</li>
            <li>175 grams sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>Zest of 1/2 lemon</li>
            <li>1 generous cup grated carrot (2 medium carrots)</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups self-raising flour (250 cc cup)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>I directly added sweet spices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lemon glaze</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Enough lemon juice (a few drops)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine sugar, eggs, and oil. Beat well, then add lemon zest and grated carrot.</li>
            <li>
                Add spices and sifted flour. Beat until well combined, then transfer the mixture into a 
                greased and floured pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in a preheated oven at 190ºC (375ºF) for approximately 45-50 minutes. Prepare the glaze. 
                Gradually add lemon juice or warm water to the powdered sugar until it reaches a runny 
                consistency, but not too liquid. Drizzle over the cake.
            </li>
            <li>Spread the glaze over the Carrot Cake using a spatula or spoon.</li>
        </ol>
